ecomextra
E commerce shopping cart. A complete store front and shopping cart solution. Based on the popular OsCommerce© shopping cart, ecomextra takes your store to a new level.

1) Template engine. Full themes that can be dropped in and switched to via the admin area. No coding required to change up the layout of your store. Template designers can decide to use the 960 grid system included or use their own. The template engine looks for which css files to include in the configuration files of each theme.

2) Plugins. New or changes to functionality are handled by plugins that "hook" into the core code. The hook api is heavily based on the Wordpress© hook api.
This is just the beginning. We are a long way from release. If you would like to be a part of the development team send an email
